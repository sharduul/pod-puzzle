Notes:
In current form, this application should satisfy the given scope of project. In case of real world application, I would have added following things:
- NPM package manager to install all the dependencies instead of using CDN versions
- Gulp task runner to automate tasks like converting LESS to CSS, jsLint, including all controllers and services in the app, minifying .js and .css files and much more.
- Unit tests using front end unit testing frameworks like Karma
